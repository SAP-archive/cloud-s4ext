title: "Week 2: UX Extension"
permalink: /week-2/
excerpt: "In week 2 you will start to write your first real extension. This extension will improve an existing **Manage Products** Fiori back-end application by a small User Experience (UX) change. By means of this UX extension the low rated products (e.g. IT equipment) in the procurement catalog can be easily identified and based on that business decisions can be taken."
