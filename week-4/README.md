title: "Week 4: Analytical Extension using SAP HANA on HCP and the Data Replication Pattern"
permalink: /week-4/
excerpt: "In this week we will introduce the **data replication extension pattern** to create an analytical application using a **SAP HANA database running on the SAP HANA Cloud Platform**. Data will be replicated from the SAP S/4HANA backend system to the HANA database on HCP using the** SAP Landscape Transformation Replication Server** (SLT). Based on the replicated data in the HANA database, you can create a new SAP Fiori based analyitical tool, that allows Peter Procurement to identify unpopular equipment with a low customer rating, that he may remove from the IT catalog."
