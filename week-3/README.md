title: "Week 3: Collaboration"
permalink: /week-3/
excerpt: "In week 3 you will build a different extension type, a **collaborative extension**.
This extension enhances the _Manage Products_ SAP Fiori application you created in week 2, so that a business user may select any product (e.g. IT equipment) and **open a collaborative discussion forum** (by using the **SAP HANA Cloud Platform - Jam** service) and invite other users to **discuss the reasons for why the ratings for the specific producs are bad** and **take appropriate business decisions** (e.g. remove the low-rated product from the catalogue) as a consequence."
