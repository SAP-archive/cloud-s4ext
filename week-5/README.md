title: "Week 5: IoT Extension using the Hub Pattern and IoT Services"
permalink: /week-5/
excerpt: "In this week you will learn about the **Internet-of-Things (IoT) service on SAP HANA Cloud Platform** and how to build a **Java application to implement the data hub extension pattern**. First you will enable the IoT service in your HCP account and set it up. You will connect sensors to the IoT service, which are used to detect damages to IT equipment in our course scenario. Then you will create a Java Hub application, that integrates data from the IoT service with data in the SAP HANA database in your HCP account and expose this as **OData service using Apache Olingo**. Finally you will create a SAP Fiori application that allows you to attach sensors to IT equipment that has been ordered from your store, using the OData service that you created."
