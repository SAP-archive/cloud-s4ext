	<h1>Hub V2: JPA and OData Service</h1>
	<p>
		This hub combines replicated data from the S/4HANA backend and
		from registered sensor devices. The app creates several helper tables
		and views that are used to provide an OData API.
	<p>

	<h2>HelloWorld Servlet</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Open <a href="./HelloWorldServlet" target="_blank">HelloWorldServlet</a> to show that the hub is up and running.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>JPA Data Preview Servlet</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Open <a href="./jpaPreview" target="_blank">jpaPreview</a> to show some data that the hub is reading using JPA.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>OData Service Servlet</h2>
	<h3>Information about the OData Service</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			GET <a href="./odata.svc/" target="_blank">odata.svc/</a>
			<p>
				A list of all Entity Sets that are exposed by the OData Service
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			GET <a href="./odata.svc/$metadata" target="_blank">odata.svc/$metadata</a>
			<p>
				The metadata document for the OData service with information about provided Entity Sets, data types and data model.
			</p>
		</li>		
	</ul>
	<h3>OData Services</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			GET <a href="./odata.svc/IoTDevices" target="_blank">odata.svc/IoTDevices</a>
			<p>
				 OData service that will hold a synchronized copy of all sensor devices that are registered at the SAP HCP IoT service.
				 As long there are no sensor devices registered in the SAP HCP IoT service this service will return no values.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			GET <a href="./odata.svc/FreeDevices" target="_blank">odata.svc/FreeDevices</a>
			<p>
				OData service that will return all sensor devices registered at the SAP HCP IoT Service and that are not yet
 				registered to an equipment.
				<br>
 				If all available sensor devices are already registered to an equipment then this service will return no values.
 			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			GET <a href="./odata.svc/DamageDatas" target="_blank">odata.svc/DamageDatas</a>
			<p>
 				OData service that will calculate and return equipment that have acceleration sensor values recorded with
 				values higher than +3g or smaller -3g along the X, Y or Z axis. Such values are considered as damage so
 				that the returned data is the list of all equipment with a potential damage.
				<br>
 				If there is no sensor device registered to an equipment and if no sensor acceleration values >3 are recorded,
 				then this view will return no values.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			GET <a href="./odata.svc/SalesOrders" target="_blank">odata.svc/SalesOrders</a>
			<p>
				OData service returning all sales orders including the number of ordered equipment and the number of equipment that
				is registered to a sensor device.
				<br>
				You can navigate with this service:
				<ul>
					<li>
						GET <a
						href="./odata.svc/SalesOrders('<valid Sales Order NodeKey>')/EquipmentDetails"
						target="_blank">odata.svc/SalesOrders('NodeKey')/EquipmentDetails</a>
						<p>
							Get the details for all equipment ordered with the specified sales order.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			GET <a href="./odata.svc/Equipment2Devices" target="_blank">odata.svc/Equipment2Devices</a>
			<p>
				OData service linking equipment to device sensors to indicate that the sensor is registered for the equipment.
 				If a sensor device is registered for an equipment this indicates that there might be acceleration data and
 				with this also damage data recorded for the equipment. As long no sensor device is registered to any device this table will be empty.
 				<br>
 				You can navigate with this service:
				<ul>
					<li>
						GET <a
						href="./odata.svc/Equipment2Devices'<valid EquipmentKey>')/EquipmentDetails"
						target="_blank">odata.svc/Equipment2Devices('EquipmentKey')/EquipmentDetails</a>
						<p>
							Get the details for an equipment that has a registered sensor device.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						POST <a href="./odata.svc/Equipment2Devices" target="_blank">odata.svc/Equipment2Devices</a>
						
						<p>
							Create new entries to relate an equipment to a sensor device. You can test this service <body>
								sending a POST request with Content-Type=application/json and payload:<BR>
								<code>
										{ <BR>
											"GDevice":"your DeviceId", <BR>
											"GDeviceName":"your Device Name", <BR>
											"EquipmentKey": "your Equipment"<BR>
										}
								</code>
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			GET <a href="./odata.svc/Equipments" target="_blank">odata.svc/Equipments</a>
			<p>
				OData service that will return all ordered equipment along with some master data, information if there are
 				sensor devices registered for the equipment and some master date for the sensor device.
 				If no sensor device is registered the respective columns will be empty.
 				<br>
 				You can navigate with this service:
 				<ul>
 					<li>
						GET <a
						href="./odata.svc/Equipments('<valid EquipmentKey>')/SalesOrderDetails"
						target="_blank">odata.svc/Equipments('EquipmentKey')/SalesOrderDetails</a>
					</li>
					<p>
						Get the details for the sales order with which this equipment was ordered.
					</p>
				</ul>

		</li>
	</ul>
