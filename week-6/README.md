title: "Week 6: IoT Extension with the Hub Pattern and Integration in legacy Business Processes"
permalink: /week-6/
excerpt: "In this Week 6 you will extend the hub pattern to integrate the IoT extension in the existing legacy sales order handling process.
You will integrate the IoT Extension in sales order business process so that data is only collected for equipments that have been actually delivered to employees. As the respective process is not yet exposed via an API of the S/4 HANA backend, the backend will be enhanced with an extension point to manage the sales order status via a custom Remote Function Module. The IoT extension will be enhanced so that sensor data is only collected for products that are actually delivered to employees."
