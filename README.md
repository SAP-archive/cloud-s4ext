# Course Summary
SAP S/4HANA is a real-time ERP suite for digital business. Built on SAP’s advanced in-memory platform, SAP HANA, it offers a personalized, consumer-grade user experience with SAP Fiori. SAP HANA Cloud Platform is an open standards-based, in-memory platform-as-a-service (PaaS) designed for today’s increasingly networked, mobile, social and data-driven world. SAP HANA Cloud Platform is available to enable companies to build their own extensions and adapt standard business software to their needs.
