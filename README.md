# What is an openSAP course?
[openSAP](https://open.sap.com) is an Enterprise MOOC platform for _massive open online courses_ (aka. MOOCs) provided by SAP. Everyone can enroll in openSAP courses, which are provided _free of charge_. The course duration is six weeks and the lectures are delivered through videos on the [openSAP website](https://open.sap.com/courses/hcp3a1/). Additionally, we have created this GitHub page with detailed step-by-step instructions including some hints, tips and tricks for different operating systems that didn't fit in the video. At the beginning of each week, we will update this site and add the new tutorials.

Optionally, as a part of the openSAP course, students may take exams at the end of each week and in a final exam at the end of the course. If you pass the exams, you will be awarded an [**openSAP Certificate**](https://open.sap.com/pages/roa_guidelines) that may even be added to your LinkedIn profile.

**Note:** Even though the course is now closed, you can still access the videos and PDFs in self-paced mode. If you didn’t get the opportunity to earn a record of achievement during the scheduled course time and would like to do so, you can reactivate the assignments and final exam by purchasing a reactivation code at [SAP Store](https://www.sapstore.com/cart/add/checkoutV2/99048v) for €39. Find out more about openSAP [reactivation codes](https://open.sap.com/pages/course_reactivation).
